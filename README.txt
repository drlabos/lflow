Python notebooks contain description and solution of some stochastic optimization problems.
Comments in notebooks are in russian, sorry, need inspiration to translate.

smooth approximations - short description of main LFlow classes and functionality. Also describes some theoretical aspects of probability and quantile optimization.

avia - probability constrained problem. We aim to reduce the area of airport runway, keeping the probability of successfull landing high.

sheeps - probability constrained problem. We aim to choose cheapest system containing solar cell, water purifier, cistern and external source of water.
The system must meet the requirements in water consumption with given probability.

wind - determine the set of possible wind speed and directions at the moment of aircraft departure, so that with given probability the aircraft will 
receive landing permit at the destination point. We induce stochastic model for future wind speed and direction based on current parameters

polyline - maximization of probability that one polyhedral function (loss function - maximum from the set of linear functions) will not exceed specified level, 
and other polyhedral function will not exceed zero (constraint function)
